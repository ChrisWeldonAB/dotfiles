# ZSH Config Directory 
Welcome to my zsh config! 

Written by: Chris

I use the **zim** framework to help handle themes, autocompletion, and extra modules and goodies.
Zim is very lightweight and fast (I prefere it over oh-my-zsh)


### Outline 
Important note: `.zshenv` is located in $HOME because this is the best place to set $ZDOTDIR.
Important ENV values should go in `.zprofile`

```
bin/        # Contains a growing pile of useful commands I use.
.zshrc      # Largely autogenerated. Any custom config is put at very bottom
.zprofile   # Where ENV values whould go

```

### Custom Commands

Custom commands should all go in `zsh/bin/` directory. I have no problem with aliases, just prefer 
to have any logic in an executable file, and an alias pointing to said executable.
